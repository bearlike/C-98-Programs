# C++98: Project Based Learning

Contains miscellaneous fun projects to aid learning C++98 better.

## Getting Started

These C++98 programs will help you understand various aspects of programming and nuances of programming.

### Prerequisites
You may have MS-DOS installed on bare metal or in VirtualBox. It may not work under Windows systems.

### Setup Environment

* Install MS-DOS under VirtualBox.
See: [How to Install DOS 6.22 Under VirtualBox](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Install-DOS-622-Under-VirtualBox/?ALLSTEPS)
* Copy source files to MS-DOS guest. You should first create a virtual floppy disk and insert it into VirtualBox.
See: [Using MagicISO to create floppy disk image](http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-createfloppyimage.htm)
* Install Borland C++ 3.1 in MS-DOS.
See: [Downloading Borland C++ 3.1](https://winworldpc.com/download/49068656-18DA-11E4-99E5-7054D21A8599)

## Project Descriptions

###The_Truck_Rally

The Truck Rally is an endless running game developed in C++98 using the Graphic Library.

####Features

2. The difficulty of the game would increase for completion of every 1000 points.
3. Has an intro sound :)  
4. Saves the Player name and High Score in a file.

###Tic Tac Toe

###Supermarket Database Management



## Why should your first programming be C++98 ?

The Old C++98 is more of a minefield, and it's nice to learn how to navigate such a beast. It will also make you understand why things are done how they are, and what the implications of different constructs are.
